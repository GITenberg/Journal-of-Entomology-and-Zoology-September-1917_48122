_Subscription_ $1.00 to domestic, $1.25 to foreign countries.

This journal is especially offered in exchange for zoological and
entomological journals, proceedings, transactions, reports of societies,
museums, laboratories and expeditions.

The pages of the journal are especially open to western entomologists
and zoologists. Notes and papers relating to western and Californian
forms and conditions are particularly desired, but short morphological,
systematic or economic studies from any locality will be considered for
publication.

Manuscripts submitted should be typewritten on one side of paper about 8
by 11 inches. Foot notes, tables, explanations of figures, etc., should
be written on separate sheets. Foot notes and figures should be numbered
consecutively throughout. The desired position of foot notes and figures
should be clearly indicated in the manuscript.

Figures should be drawn so that they may be reproduced as line cuts so
far as possible. An unusually large number of half tones must be paid
for in part by the author. Other more expensive illustrations will be
furnished at cost. Figures for cuts should be made to conform to the size
of the page when reduced, that is, 5 by 7½ inches or less. The lettering
should be by means of printed numbers and letters pasted on the drawings,
in most cases.

Authors of articles longer than a thousand words will receive fifty
reprints of their publications free of cost. If more than this are
desired, the order should be given with the return of the proof sheets.
Extra copies and special covers or special paper will be furnished at
cost. Authors of short contributions will receive a few extra copies of
the number containing their articles.

Manuscripts should be sent by express or registered mail.

List of Bees from Claremont-Laguna Region

HENRY BRAY


Through the kindness of Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell and several others I
have been able to get large numbers of our local bees determined. The
basis of the work was the extensive Cook-Baker collection of the college
with additional material of my own and others. Many of the species here
listed have been collected by me and others, but unless not represented
in the original college collection it is not noted in the list. So far as
the relations of bees to plants has been noted by me it is given in the
list. Many other species remain to be determined and only a beginning has
been made in respect to the relation of the bees to plants.

A Partial List of the Mammals of the Claremont Region

LEON L. GARDNER


Since little or nothing has been published on mammals of this region
it was deemed advisable to print a list even though very incomplete
and based on preliminary and limited collecting in order to have some
definite forward step in this much neglected line. Some of the mammals
listed below have not been collected by us but are known to occur. Thanks
are due Mr. H. S. Swaith for his kind aid in identification of some of
the skins collected.

Bears of course have long since disappeared but still have left their
reputation among old mountaineers. The story goes that a bear, perhaps
the last one, was killed at Bear Flats on the trail to "Old Baldy," hence
the name.

_Odocoileus hemionus californicus._ (Caton.) California Mule Deer. Fairly
common through Upper Sonoran and Transition zones. They have been taken
as low as the mouth of San Dimas canyon. The recently established game
preserve assures an increase in the future. Already they seem to have
sensed the protection for on May 19, 1916, we were surprised to find just
75 feet before us a large doe on the auto road not far above the first
power house.

_Ovis canadensis nelsoni?_ C. M. Merriam. Merriam Desert Bighorn.
Mountain sheep have lived for years in the higher peaks above Claremont
but being very shy and in inaccessible and little frequented parts have
escaped attention very successfully. Rumor has it that Mountain Goats
are found with the sheep but I believe this to be unfounded, having been
originated probably by the sight of the smaller horned females and young.
The area occupied by the sheep is a very definite one and comprises the
peaks Ontario, Cucamonga, Telegraph, St. Antonio ("Old Baldy"), and
Iron Mountain with their high rocky intervening ridges. Of the points
mentioned the first three peaks are the favored ones. I found only a few
tracks on Iron Mountain and a rumor of a pair of horns found there some
five or eight years ago. "Old Baldy" being too often visited is not a
frequented spot for the sheep, serving only as a connecting link to Iron
Mountain. However signs around Ontario, Cucamonga and Telegraph peaks
are abundant and anyone with a little patience and diligent endeavor
can readily see the sheep themselves. They travel often in bands, as
many as fifty and in summer keep to the highest places. Where they go in
winter is as yet a mystery to me, probably lower into canyon heads for I
have never found them on the top during this season. This of course is
natural for these peaks practically become great ice mountains dangerous
for anything to travel over. Besides grass the food consists of twigs
and leaves of _Castonapsis sempewirens_, several species of _Ceanothus_,
_Rhammus croceus californicus_, _Rhus trilobata_ and a parsnip _Pastinaca
sativa_.

_Citellus beecheyi._ Richardson. California Ground Squirrel. Abundant in
all parts from brush land to 8,000 feet altitude in suitable localities.

_Sciurus griseus anthonyi._ Mearns. Anthony Gray Squirrel. Very common
in the transition zone. In early spring they start working on pine cones
on the mountain tops, gradually coming down to more abundant supplies of
food until fall finds them down in the oak belt feeding on acorns. They
winter as low as Palmers canyon in some cases.

_Entamias Sp._ Abundant in the pine belt and as high as the top of
"Baldy." They are good climbers, exceedingly active and bursting with
curiosity.

_Onychomys torridus ramona._ Rhoads. San Bernardino Grasshopper Mouse.
But two specimens of this carnivorous mouse were taken in a period of
trapping extending over three months. Both specimens were taken on bait
consisting of rolled oats and in the same place, east of Indian Hill in
the brush. A good many of my specimens were more or less devoured in the
traps in this locality, and I strongly suspect this mouse of the crime.
Nowhere else were my mice eaten or were any grasshopper mice taken.

_Peromyscus maniculatus gambeli._ Baird. Gambel White-footed Mouse. This
species was one of the most common forms taken, being abundant in the
brushy valley and foothills. There is a great deal of color variation in
the specimens taken.

_Peromyscus boylei rowleyi._ (Allen.) Rowley White-footed Mouse. No
specimens were trapped in the valley. However these mice were found
not uncommon at the mouth of Palmers canyon, just four miles north of
Claremont, in the dry brush land. Within the canyon they were common and
were taken as high as the top of Ontario peak along fallen logs. At Camp
Baldy they are very common especially along watercourses and fallen logs.
Indications are that they ignore zonal limits being taken well down in
Lower Sonoran zone and in high transition and not necessarily near water.

_Peromyscus californicus insignis._ Rhoads. Chemisal Mouse. Not common.
None were taken in the valley and few in the canyons. They were not found
along waterways but frequently brushy hillsides. This is a large species
of mouse and was almost too much for the little "gee whiz" traps to hold.

_Peromyscus eremicus fraterculus._ Miller. Dulzura Mouse. Common in the
brush land of both valley and foothill, being found in the canyons also.

_Reithrodontomys megalotis longicauda._ Baird. Long-tailed Harvest Mouse.
Common in valley and foothill. Although partial to grassy areas (I took
many in the grassy runways made by meadow mice--Microtus californicus). I
found them not uncommon in the dry brush land east of Indian Hill.

_Neotoma fuscipes macrotis._ Thomas. Southern Brush Rat. Common from
valley to 5,000 feet in the mountains in suitable localities. I took one
in the property house at the Greek theatre this June. The large nests are
seen very commonly in the canyons and hillsides.

_Neotoma intermedia intermedia._ Rhoads. Intermediate Brush Rat. There
seems to be a curious reversal of conditions between this and the former
species. Whereas this species is supposed to be taken only up to 3,000
feet, I took none _below_ 3,000, all being taken at 5,000 feet or more
along fallen logs near watercourses, and the former species was limited
more distinctly to the foothills which is not a typical condition.

_Microtus californicus californicus._ (Peale.) California Meadow Mouse.
Common in runways through the grass in damp canyons, at Palmers canyon
and in other suitable localities. One was taken as high as Kelly's
cabin--on Ontario peak, among fallen logs by a cold mountain stream.
While setting trap in the runways I more than once caught glimpses of
them darting along the aisles in the grass.

_Thomomys bottæ pallescens._ Rhoads. Southern Pocket Gopher. Abundant in
the valley, often doing much damage in lawns and orchards.

_Perodipus agilis agilis._ (Gambel.) Gambel Kangaroo Rats. Abundant from
valley to Transition zone. I found them abundant at Brown's Flats where
the evidences of their digging and their holes are on every side. I have
trapped them in brush country, rocky areas, open brushless places, and at
the mouth of ground squirrel holes.

_Lepus californicus._ (Gray.) Jack-Rabbit. Common in the valley and to a
certain extent in the foothills and higher.

_Sylvilagus auduboni sanctidiegi._ (Miller.) San Diego Cottontail.
Abundant in the Lower Sonoran zone. Increasing each year due to the
protection afforded by game laws. Considerable damage to young trees is
done by cottontails and they are a great pest to the farmer.

_Sylvilagus bachmani cinerascens._ (Allen.) Ashy Brush Rabbit. Fairly
common in the brush. They are not swift runners and rely on escaping by
hiding behind clumps of brush. This is more typically an Upper Sonoran
form.

_Felis oregonensis oregonensis._ (Rafinesque.) Pacific Cougar. Numberless
reports are always coming in of Mountain Lions and as usual most of them
prove to be unfounded. However authentic records of these beasts are
not lacking. I have personally inspected a specimen shot in Cold Water
Canyon not more than five years ago. Tradition has it that at one time
a mountaineer was actually besieged for two days in the little cabin at
Browns Flats. Lions have been seen at Browns Flats, Cattle Canyon and the
north of Telegraph peak. Mountaineers tell me that they are a great deal
more common in the San Gabriel drainage. The specimen which I saw was
from one of the tributary canyons to the San Gabriel river.

_Lynx eremicus californicus._ (Mearns.) California Wild Cat. Common in
the mountains and ranging over the valley. About once a year a specimen
is brought in to be skinned or identified and great stories are told
about them. One of the commonest fallacies is that there are two forms
in the mountains, one a "Bob cat" with short tail and ear tufts, and
the other a true "Link" or Lynx with longer tail and more prominent ear
tufts. It is little wonder, however, that such a notion exists in view
of the fact of the great range or variations found in these animals. As
for actual records of captures. In the summer of 1911 one was shot in
the brushy hillsides of Laguna Canyon (Orange Co.) and brought in to the
Marine Laboratory. In the spring of 1912 a [F] was shot at the mouth of
San Dimas canyon and brought to the college. In December 1914 a [F] in
very worn pelage was shot while crossing the Santa Ana river near Prado
Beach and brought to me to be skinned. Finally while trapping for foxes
in Palmers canyon in March of 1916 I took a male.

_Canis ochropus ochropus._ (Eschscholtz.) California Coyote. Common in
the brush land above Claremont and in the foothills. The yapping bark is
a very familiar cry to any who live near the outskirts of the town and
may be heard nearly any evening. Although having camped numerous times in
the mountains I have never heard Coyotes above the foothill region.

_Urocyon cinereoargenteus californicus._ (Mearns.) California Gray Fox.
Signs of foxes in the canyons and along mountain trails are always
quite common. Foeces containing seeds of manzanita berries are familiar
occurrences. They are fond of fruit and are readily trapped with such
bait. In March 1916 three were caught one night at the same place in Live
Oak canyon.

_Procyon psora psora._ (Gray.) California Coon. Coons are fairly common
in the larger canyons where there is an abundance of water. I have seen
their tracks in Palmers, Cucamonga and San Antonio canyons. Three were
trapped this winter (1916) just above Camp Baldy at an altitude of about
5400 feet.

_Mephitis occidentalis holzneri._ (Mearns.) Southern California Striped
Skunk. Not very common in this region, found mostly in the Upper Sonoran
zone in wooded districts.

_Spilogale phenax phenax._ (C. H. Merriam.) California Spotted Skunk.
Very common in valley, foothills and up to 6,000 feet in the mountains.
They are fearless little creatures and will readily enter cabins in the
mountains and keep the occupant awake by rattling pots and pans while
scrambling around in search of food, needless to say creating an awkward
situation for the host. They have been known to take up their abode
underneath houses in Claremont and take the liberty of scampering around
the parlor floor without regard to the presence of human beings. This
was a common occurrence in a certain family I have in mind and on such
occasions the unwelcome guest was gently ushered to the door without
hurting its feelings and peace of mind restored to the household. They
are the easiest of all animals to trap and made considerable trouble and
embarrassment for me by continually blundering into traps of mine set for
other game. I have found these little creatures as high as 6,000 feet in
the canyons.

_Mustela xanthogenys xanthogenys._ (Gray.) California Weasel. I had
always been interested in weasels as to their occurrence and until this
year had taken only one in town with a record of only two or three seen
along the railroad track. Then in one week four weasels were given me
and a record of seven others obtained, all these are from nearby orange
groves and from below town along the railroad track where for a long time
I have known they occurred.

_Scapanus latimanus occultus._ (Grinnell and Swartz.) Southern California
Mole. Moles are occasionally caught in orchards and lawns and the
characteristic workings are familiar sights in the mountains up to 8,000
feet. Our specimens were all from the valley.

_Antrozous pallidus pacificus._ (Merriam.) Pacific Pale Bat. I have
taken several of these bats from behind pictures and in the attics of
some of the college buildings. I do not know their relative abundance or
distribution but they are certainly common on the campus in spring and
summer.

_Myotis evotis._ (Allen.) Long-eared Bat. This form also occurs in the
college buildings and I believe to a certain extent in the mountains.

A Preliminary List of Shells from Laguna Beach and Nearby


For a number of years past students have collected shells from Laguna
Beach, these and the Bradshaw collection form the basis for this list,
which includes shells not farther than ten or twelve miles up and down
the coast. The earlier collections were by Mabel Guernsey and P. R.
Daggs. Practically all the shells drawn and photographed are from the
Bradshaw collection because the shells were in better condition. Some
of the earlier specimens were determined by the United States National
Museum. Suggestions and corrections were kindly made by Mrs. T. S.
Oldroyd. The photographs are by Robins and Cooper. Many of the drawings
are by Miss Margaret Cate. Doubtful specimens are largely omitted in this
list, but a few are included and marked by a question.

A Reconstruction of the Nervous System of a Nemertian Worm

WILLIAM A. HILTON


Small specimens of _Carinella cingulata_ Cole were fixed in Mercuric
chloride and cut in series. A general hematoxylin stain was very
satisfactory for general anatomy. For a study of the finer structure
other preparations will be necessary.

No attempt will be made to give a complete review of the literature
relating to this group. Almost every systematic paper has something,
because of the importance of the nervous system in classification
and because in many cases the nervous system may be seen through the
body-wall without dissection.

One of the first extensive accounts of these animals which also included
quite a consideration of the nervous system was McIntosh in 1874. Several
of the genus Nemestes were studied and the general form of the nervous
system shown. Amphipheris is shown in a similar manner with a single
lobe of the brain and with the two brain commissures. Tetrastemma is
shown in a similar manner. Hubrecht in 1887 has an extensive paper in
which the details of several nervous systems are shown as they show in
reconstructions from sections. _Eupolia girardi_ is especially well shown
with its small dorsal and large ventral commissure and with three brain
lobes. It is in this paper that Hubrecht makes his interesting comparison
between the nemertians and cordates. In his paper of 1880 he has shown
the structure and position of different parts of the nervous system of
nemertians, especially of Cerebratulus of which he gives a very good
figure. In this he shows a reconstruction of the brain with its chief
nerves, ventral and dorsal commissures, general position of the cells,
the two lobes of the brain on each side and the chief nerves. He also
treats of nemertian nervous systems of many other forms, but not in so
much detail.

Burger in 1890, '91, has extensive papers on the nervous system of the
group. He discusses not only the general form, but also the minute
structure of the nervous system of a number of different types. In 1895
Burger has another important paper on this group of animals. In it he
shows in some forms a marked dorsal ganglion and a ventral ganglion with
the typical nerves. Burger showed that all ganglion cells are unipolar,
without membranes. Montgomery, 1897, discusses the minute anatomy of the
nerve cells. Coe, 1895 and 1910, considers the general anatomy of the
nervous system, but nerve details are for the most part not shown.

In a young _Carinella cingulata_ Cole which I have studied by means
of reconstructions, I find no unusual features. The nervous system is
typical of the group. The brain, however, is not very clearly made up of
two lobes on each side. This may be because the specimen used was a young
one. This may also be the reason why the brain is not sharply marked off
from the lateral nerve cords.

Figure 1 shows the brain and part of the lateral cords from the ventral
side. From the two halves of the brain come the nerves to forward parts.
The small dorsal commissure is shown with its usual median extension.
From the larger ventral commissure come the two nerves to the proboscis,
lateral to these are the nerves to the intestine, while from the ridge of
the lateral cords the lateral nerves are shown.

Figure 2 in the larger drawing at the right shows the nervous system as
viewed from the side with the dorsal side to the left. The central core
of the ganglion and cord is to indicate the position of the fiber area.
The small drawings at the left show various levels of the nervous system
as seen in cross section. The ventral side is up. The drawing at the top
is through the brain before the commissures are reached, the next lower
is through the thickest part of the brain and the lower two drawings are
through one of the lateral cords.

Is of great value in all biological work where low and medium powers
are employed. In embryology the true stereoscopic image shows the
relative position of important details. This feature is of great
assistance to the student and makes the instructor's work easy.

Located in one of the most healthful and beautiful parts of the
west coast. The mountains reach an elevation of ten thousand feet
within a few miles of the college and these with the nearby ocean
afford many special advantages for the study of things not in books.
Special advantages are afforded by the fact that the college limits
its attendance, the freshman class being restricted to two hundred
applicants. The success of the college is particularly indicated by the
large proportion of the graduates who proceed to advanced work in the
large universities. In addition, well-manned departments of music and
art afford exceptional advantages.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
